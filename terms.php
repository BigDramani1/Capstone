                                        <p> You must be a registered user to bid on items. By bidding, you are stating that you are ready and willing to purchase that item for your bid amount, plus any shipping charges disclosed in the listing. If you are outbid, or your bid does not meet the reserve price, you are under no obligation to buy. But in all other cases, you are entering a contract to buy the item, and to deliver payment within the time period specified (48 hours from auction closing). If you cannot pay please don’t bid. Your bids are final and non-retractable. We will not accept e-mail bids.</p>
                                        <p>Your satisfaction is our top priority; we strive to offer excellent Customer Service to our clients. There would be no refunds on any Items purchased. You should view the products before making payments for it.</p>
                                        <p>If any bidder wins the auction and fails to purchase that product within 48 hours period, they will receive a strike, and the product will be given to the next bidder in line.</p>

To register, the Bidder must provide all of the registration information requested, and sign the Agreement by checking the ‘I AGREE’ box. By checking this box, you acknowledge that you are binding yourself to this contractual agreement. The support team reserves the right to refuse to register or admit any person at its sole discretion. Invoices and correspondence relating to purchases will be sent in accordance with the information on the bidder’s registration. Your registration will be accepted but your information will be verified and your account may be disabled until the necessary information is provided to verify the account.</p>

The Starting Bid is designed to encourage bidding. If an item is incorrectly described online, the support team reserves the right to rectify such error and email to all active bidders the correct description.</p>

                                    <h5 class="subtitle">Extended Bidding</h5>
                                    <p>The support team uses an “extended bidding” process to close all of our auctions. After 8:00 pm GMT, for the current auction, the auction will continue for any lots that have multiple bids until there are no bids placed on any lots in the auction in a fifteen (15) minute time frame until 9:00 pm GMT. You MUST place a bid on the lot in order to bid in extended bidding. Any lots with only one bid will close at the beginning of extended bidding.</p>
                                    <p>For example, during “extended bidding”, if Item #1 receives a bid within the initial fifteen (15) minute time frame through 9:00pm GMT, the auction is extended 15 minutes. All bidders are all on the same playing field and are all equipped with the information required to ensure that the only reason they do not win a given lot is they are not interested in the lot or the price for the lot went above their threshold. The auction is not closed until all bids have been made, and when the auction is closed, the high bidder on every lot is the person who is willing to pay the most for the item. This is precisely what auctions are supposed to accomplish.</p>
